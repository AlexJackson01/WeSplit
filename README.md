# WeSplit

#### My first app with Swift and SwiftUI, following Paul Hudson's '100 Days of SwiftUI'. I followed the initial tutorial before completing challenges in my own time.

## Challenges
1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
3. Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%. Tip: use the range 0..<101 for your range rather than a fixed array.

## Future enhancements
1. Check if service is already included before asking about tips
2. Clearing default £0 when input is focused
